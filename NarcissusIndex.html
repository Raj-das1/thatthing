<h1 style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif">The Tragic Tale of Echo and Her Love for Narcissus
</h1>
<p style="font-family: cursive;">One day, Zeus met some nymphs he was romantically attracted to, so he decided to hang out with them. When Hera, Zeus's wife, came to check up on her husband, one overprotective nymph by the name of Echo tried to distract her from finding out about Zeus's affair. However, Echo had failed. After finding out, Hera punished Echo, cursing her to only be able to repeat the last word that she heard. After that, Echo never talked to anyone since she couldn't voice her thoughts, so she wandered the forest aimlessly. One day, she meets a very handsome man whose name is Narcissus and immediately falls in love with him. Soon, Narcissus is separated from the friends that he was with. When he tries to call out for them, Echo just repeats the same words back to him. Eventually, Echo rushes to him from hiding, and Narcissus is creeped out and rudely asks her to go away. Nemesis looks upon Echo from Olympus and becomes angry at how he treated the nymph. So, Nemesis leads Narcissus to a pond. When he sees his reflection in the pond, he falls in love with it, not knowing it is himself. After that, Narcissus kept on staring at his reflection until he withered away and died. In other interpretations, he attempted to kiss his reflection and drowned in the pond. On the other hand, Echo is still infatuated with Narcissus for the rest of her life until she dies. Now, her voice is all that is left of her as an echo.
